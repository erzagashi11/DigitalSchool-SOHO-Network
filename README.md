# Digital School SOHO Network  

This project involves designing and implementing a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network for a two-story digital school using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is tailored to meet the operational, educational, and administrative requirements of the school.  

Key Features:  
- **Two-story structure**:  
  - Ground floor: Administrative offices, reception, and similar facilities.  
  - First floor: Classrooms, IT support, directorâ€™s office, and student labs.  
- **VLAN Segmentation**:  
  - VLAN 10: Administration and staff (Blue).  
  - VLAN 20: Classrooms and student areas (Green).  
  - VLAN 30: IT support and critical network services (Yellow).  
- **Static IP configuration** with efficient subnetting using a /21 mask for future scalability.  
- **Integrated devices**: Computers, laptops, VoIP phones, IoT devices, printers, and servers.  
- **Security Measures**: Subnet isolation, VLAN segmentation, and firewall implementation.  
- Simulated, tested, and configured using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  

This project demonstrates a robust, scalable, and secure network infrastructure that supports the technological and educational demands of a modern digital school.
